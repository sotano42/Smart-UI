# Smart-UI framework for Construct 3
Smart UI is a framework and set of addons designed to simplify UI design and development in the Construct 3 game engine. One of Construct 3's weakest features is UI design, as it relies entirely on HTML/CSS, which tends to perform poorly when exported to the Cordova wrapper. As a result, many developers have opted to create their own UI systems using sprites and custom ACEs within the engine to achieve the desired behavior. However, the main drawback of this approach is its low portability, as Construct lacks the prefab capabilities provided by other engines, limiting reuse. This challenge led to the development of Smart UI, a plug-and-play set of addons that can be included in any world instance to function as specific UI components.

All the addons were built with support for the following features/capabilities:

- UI composition and navigation based on the Object Hierarchy/Scene Graph.
- Long-term compatibility with native Construct 3 SDK features.
- Container-based interactions for managing component focus, document flow, and default actions, as well as grouping components to create operational contexts.
- Focus management, sibling interactions, and clipping based on containers and views.
- Modal and non-modal dialog windows.
- Load/Save game states.
- zIndex-based interactivity to respond to the top-most valid components.
- Flexibility for custom design.
- Simple implementation and easy-to-understand ACEs.
- Advanced minification using UglifyJS (Closure Compiler is not supported).
- Worker mode support for all addons. 

## The tool is currently in closed-alpha testing. If you've reached the repository, you were probably invited to it.
